AudioLabs is the second chapter in my freelance journey, which began under the name Strange Space Studios back in 2020. When I first started thinking about what I wanted to offer through this business, I wasn’t exactly sure where to anchor myself.

But I knew one thing for certain: I wanted to be a freelancer.
With that singular focus, I took the leap—setting up my ABN and taking on any gig I could get my foot into. Along the way, I honed my skills, not just as a better operator, but in learning how to secure and deliver work. This mindset led me to places I never imagined, teaching me
invaluable lessons.

It showed me that delivering your best work is non-negotiable and just as opportunities can land in your lap for you to capitalise one, they can also slip through your fingers like sand.

Looking back, calling it “jumping the gun” would be an understatement when I first launched Strange Space Studios. I had just come out of full-time work with an event entertainment hire company—entry level work. I was still learning the ropes with Ableton Live and music production and I lacked the industry knowledge and reputation to truly make a mark. But I was young, with no major responsibilities (not much has changed there), so I jumped in with both feet—straight into the deep end.
For years, I operated like that—especially during my time in Alice Springs. I took on anything and everything just to gain experience, learning by doing. Some of those decisions led to disasters, but many resulted in significant wins. Thankfully, the wins outweighed the losses, and I’m still here, doing what I love.

So why am I sharing this now? I think it’s important for anyone considering working with me—or following this business journey—to understand where I’ve come from, where I am today, and
where I hope to go. AudioLabs has been a dream of mine for a long time, but it’s only in the last year or so, after a lot of trial and error, that it has truly taken shape.

AudioLabs is an audio production company. I record and write music, edit and post-produce audio, design soundscapes using synths and field recordings, and lead projects as they come. I hope to showcase not only the incredible projects I get to be part of but also my own creative
work.

AudioLabs exists because I now have the knowledge and confidence to offer these services and help bring people’s projects to life. There’s a saying, “If you love what you do, you’ll never work a day in your life.” Well, I don’t plan on ever working again.

I look forward to collaborating with you. Together, we’re bound to create something extraordinary.
