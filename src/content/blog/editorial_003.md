While the primary aim of the AudioLabs platform is to generate business for audio services, it also serves as a vehicle for promoting my own creative work under the alias Focal Point.

At this early stage of client and lead generation, I’ve been using my own productions as a portfolio of sorts—showcasing skills like recording, mixing, editing, and sound design, alongside writing and development of the music. Each project is an opportunity to refine these abilities, and through experimentation, discovering new techniques.

Of course, not every experiment is a success—some ideas sound horrible—but every now and then I land on something interesting, and I believe that contributes to developing your own sound or style.

Focal Point is actually my second creative venture. My first project, empyral, was inspired by my favorite album at the time, The Empyrean by John Frusciante. It marked my initial venture into electronic music after spending years as a guitarist in bands.

This current project, Focal Point, is still highly experimental in nature—exploring sound, production, and genre. While I tend to lean on the instruments available in the AudioLabs studio for a sense of continuity, there’s always room for creative evolution.

So far, I’ve released a three-track EP titled Undulation. At the time, I was heavily into chopping up drum breaks and looped percussion, which became a signature element across the tracks. Looking back, I’d love to revisit the mixes using my newer Barefoot Footprint 03 monitors, but those songs represent where I was then, and I’m content to let them stand as they are.

After Undulation, I ventured into edits and remixes. One was Closer by Satoshi & Makoto, and the other was Quarto De Hotel by Hareton Salvanini. Both were really fun to create, offering a fresh perspective and an entirely different creative process. I’m genuinely proud of how they turned out.

Now, as we enter 2025, I have my sights set on releasing a record—whether through an existing label or as a self-funded project. If I feel confident in the quality of the music, I’ll gladly take the plunge and release it independently.
